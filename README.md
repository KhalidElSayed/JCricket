   JCRICKET                         


JCricket is a simple android library to show popup hints related to existing views.

The usage is pretty simple:
   - use the builder to build a popup hint
   - use the showHint() method to display the hint

If you want to access the elements of the view, just get the view using getPopupView() method and access its elements using getViewById()

By default the hint is dismissed whenever it's tapped
